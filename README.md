# facebook-send-api-emulator
This is an emulator for Facebook Send API and Facebook Messenger which i have used in chatbot development.
The work on this application is not complete yet but feel free to contribute your views or work.
The purpose of using this is to be able to develop and debug facebook web hooks locally.

The emulator provides a local endpoint to mimic Send API functions in form of express rest api.
The messenger emulator is mostly angular application which uses bootstrap for some UI elements.
