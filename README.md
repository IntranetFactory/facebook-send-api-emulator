# Facebook Send API Emulator
This is an emulator for Facebook Send API and Facebook Messenger which i have used in chatbot development.
The purpose of using this is to be able to develop and debug facebook web hooks locally.

The emulator provides a local endpoint to mimic Send API functions in form of express rest api.
The messenger emulator is mostly angular application which uses bootstrap for some UI elements.
